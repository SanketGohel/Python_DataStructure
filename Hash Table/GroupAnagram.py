# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

# Explanation:

# There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
# The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]

# Output: [[""]]

# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]

# Output: [["a"]]
